# capture-the-flag

I'm still figuring things out, but I was on reddit and found [this question about top 10 ctf websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityCTF/comments/ewpdt8/top_10_ctf_capture_the_flag_websites/) and I have just finished my summer vacation and starting to get back to study. This repo would be serving as my notebook for studying and documenting what I'm doing to get myself acquainted with security and stuff. I'll be linking any related book/article that I will be reading.

Hopefully someone will find this beneficial :beers: :beers: :beers:
